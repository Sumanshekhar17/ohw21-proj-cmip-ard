# ohw21-proj-cmip-ard
### OceanHackWeek21 project to learn & document examples of CMIP6 workflows turning big climate projection data into useful inputs for modelling and analysis.

Goals of this project include building clean, well-commented Jupyter notebooks that document CMIP6 workflows for generating analysis ready datasets (ARD) for specific examples.  A stretch-goal for this project is to complete and publish examples, possibly in a [Pangeo Gallery](https://gallery.pangeo.io/repos/pangeo-gallery/cmip6/index.html)?

### Example 1: SST & surface nitrate projections for Arabian Sea ecological modelling
A hypothetical ecological model of the Arabian Sea includes basin averaged SST and surface nitrate as inputs.  Researchers would like to explore ecosystem responses to future climate change projections under both SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios.  A monthly timeseries through 2100, averaged over the Arabian Sea is required from a range of CMIP6 models. 

Tasks:
0. What CMIP6 models should we include in our ensemble and why? How do they perform for our areas of interest and with what known biases? (Likely out of scope - especially for this hypothetical example - but a literature review might be the first step here)
1. Load SST and surface nitrate for your chosen range of CMIP6 models (in this case arbirarily choose a few keeping in mind hub memory limits)
